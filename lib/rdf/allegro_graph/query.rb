module RDF::AllegroGraph

  # A query with AllegroGraph-specific extensions.
  #
  # Note that many of of the more exotic features of this class can only be
  # used when running Prolog queries against a Session object.  This
  # requires both elevated AllegroGraph privileges and dedicated back-end
  # session resources on the server, so plan accordingly.

  # The Functors module contains a wide variety of functors which may be
  # used when building a Prolog query.
